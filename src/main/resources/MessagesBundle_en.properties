Meaning mesh networks are better suited at serving a larger area. Although you can add WiFi extenders to a conventional network, the handoff isn't as seamless as with a mesh network. Follow the link to learn more about the differences between mesh and conventional routers (https://www.pcworld.com/article/539680/mesh-wi-fi-vs-traditional-router-which-ones-best-for-your-home.html).
